# Quantum Node.js Website

This project is a Quantum Node.js website with AI and hardware-aware features. It provides a centralized interface for interacting with various quantum computing APIs and integrates AI functionalities.

## Features

- **AI Model Training and Prediction:** Train AI models with given data and make predictions.
- **Quantum Job Execution:** Run quantum computing jobs on specified APIs and frameworks.
- **Hardware Resource Management:** Detect and configure available hardware resources (CPU, GPU, QPU).
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Configure and run asynchronous tasks with rate limiting.
- **Security:** Enhanced security with HTTP headers and rate limiting.
